# About Machine learning
Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence.

## About this
> Machine learnign is a hell of a hot topic and I have been working with it for a more than a year, in this process I had to learn A LOT in order to have a decent conversation with a Data Scientist, so I decided to share the steps I took to understand more about machine learning and even build my own models.

### What is Machine Learning

Google has a lot of content on ML, [this YouTube video gives a great summary](https://youtu.be/HcqpanDadyQ)


### Why should designers care?

I'll just leave some links here with content from awesome people, I'm sure you'll find them useful.

#### [Anticipatory Design](https://www.anticipatorydesign.com/thesis/) ``ebook``
[Joel](https://twitter.com/Jvb_nl) has this amazing thesis what covers a lot of ground on why we, as designers, should care.

#### [The UX of AI](https://design.google/library/ux-ai/) ``Article``
[Josh Lovejoy](https://twitter.com/jdlovejoy)from google has this in dept article on the work he has done on the Google Clip and I love this quote:

> The hardware, the intelligence, and the content ultimately belong to you and you alone.

#### [Predictive design](https://youtu.be/3mG03Rm0Ceg) ``Video``
I love to share, as you can see, so I spoke about how I used machine learning at Booking.com in this talk at UXDX

#### [An intro to Machine Learning for Designers](https://uxdesign.cc/an-intro-to-machine-learning-for-designers-5c74ba100257) ``Article``
A very well written and illustrated guide to common therms and general info on Machine Learning


### Getting technical

#### The machine learning **Hello Wolrd**. 
The best way to understand exactly how it works is by actually developing it. Don't be scared, the Machine Learning Hello World is not that hard here are some steps:

First, let's get your dev enviroment up and running.

1. [Install python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) | Python is a programming language.
2. [Download and install Anaconda](https://www.python.org/downloads/) | Anaconda is a package manager for python, just like NPM
3. Install the machine learning toolkit for python, [SciKit Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)
4. Profit.

Now that you have your dev environment setup just follow [this video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKxRvEZd3Mw&list=PLT6elRN3Aer7ncFlaCz8Zz-4B5cnsrOMt) by Google on coding your first ML model.
The tutorial is very simple and easy to follow, but if you just want to run the code and check its result [check out my examples](https://github.com/pmarquees/ml-playground). All of them were done while watching that Google video.
